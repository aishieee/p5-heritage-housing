        "\n",
        "* Read cleaned_data.csv and confirm the dataset shape, column structure, and absence of missing values.\n",
        "* Use appropriate libraries for analysis and visualisation:\n",
        "   - `pandas` → data manipulation  \n",
        "   - `numpy` → numerical operations  \n",
        "   - `matplotlib.pyplot` → plotting distributions and relationships  \n",
        "   - `seaborn` → advanced visualisations (correlation heatmap, boxplots, scatterplots)\n",
        "* Explore the distribution of important numerical and categorical features.\n",
        "* Investigate how different house attributes relate to `SalePrice`.\n",
        "* Visualise correlations to identify the strongest predictor variables.\n",
        "* Compare the client's inherited houses to the overall Ames market.\n",
        "* Use the insights gained to guide feature selection for the modelling notebook.\n",

        "## Inputs\n",
        "\n",
        "* `data/processed/cleaned_data.csv` - The fully cleaned main Ames Housing dataset produced in 02_data_ckeaning.ipynb.\n",
        "* `data/raw/inherited_houses.csv` - The four inherited properties that must be analysed and later predicted.\n",
        "* The following Python libraries:`pandas`,`numpy`,`matplotlib.pyplot`,`seaborn`\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Outputs\n",
        "\n",
        "* Distribution plots (histograms, KDEs, and boxplots) for key numerical features.\n",
        "* Countplots/bar charts for categorical variables.\n",
        "* Scatterplots showing relationships between numerical predictors and SalePrice.\n",
        "* Boxplots showing how categorical variables influence sale price.\n",
        "* A correlation matrix and correlation heatmap for numerical features.\n",
        "* Visual comparisons between inherited houses and the wider Ames dataset.\n",
        "* A summary of analysis findings to support feature selection for modelling.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Additional Comments\n",

        "* This notebook does not perform further data cleaning; all cleaning operations were completed in `02_data_cleaning.ipynb`.\n",
        "- Plots generated in this notebook will also be saved later for use in the Streamlit dashboard.\n",
        "- All plots and insights should contribute to answering the client’s business questions:\n",
        "  1. Which features affect house price the most?  \n",
        "  2. How do the client’s inherited houses compare to the market?\n",
        "- Insights from this analysis will directly influence the feature engineering and model training steps in the next notebook.\n"
