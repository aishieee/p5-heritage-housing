        "\n",
        "* Prepare the `cleaned_data.csv` dataset for machine learning (ML), following the modelling pipeline described in the project brief.\n",
        "* Engineer the features identified during EDA as relevant predictors of `SalePrice` (e.g., GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF, LotArea, GarageArea, OverallQual, and categorical quality ratings).\n",
        "* Convert all categorical variables into numerical format using suitable encoding techniques.\n",
        "* Apply data transformations informed by EDA - for example:\n",
        "  * log-transform `SalePrice` if required\n",
        "  * handle skewed numerical features\n",
        "  * normalise or standardise features if necessary\n",
        "* Create the final modelling dataset (`X` and `y`) and perform a train–test split to support model evaluation.\n",
        "* Apply identical feature engineering steps to `inherited_houses.csv` so predictions can be generated consistently later in the dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Inputs\n",
        "\n",
        "* `data/processed/cleaned_data.csv`\n",
        "  * Cleaned and fully validated Ames dataset produced in 02_data_cleaning.ipynb.\n",
        "* `data/raw/inherited_houses.csv`\n",
        "  * Client’s four inherited homes, used for aligning preprocessing and generating predictions later.\n",
        "* Insights from 03_exploratory_analysis.ipynb:\n",
        "  * Most predictive numerical features\n",
        "  * Categorical variables requiring encoding\n",
        "  * Level of skewness in key features\n",
        "  * Confirmation that inherited houses fall within normal market ranges\n",
        "* Project requirements and modelling expectations from the Project Plan \n",
        "  * Final model must achieve **R² ≥ 0.75**\n",
        "  * Dataset must be prepared following a clear ML pipeline\n",
        "  * Model will later be used in a Streamlit dashboard with prediction capability\n",

        "## Outputs\n",

        "  * Transformed numerical variables (if needed)\n",
        "  * Final feature matrix `X` and target `y`\n",
        "  * `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test` split for modelling\n",

        "  * `data/processed/engineered_inherited_houses.csv`\n",

        "## Additional Comments\n",
        "\n",
        "* All feature engineering decisions must directly support the modelling requirements in the project specification and dashboard design (prediction page, feature insights page, etc.).\n",
        "* No new external features will be added; only the original cleaned dataset will be transformed.\n",
        "* This notebook ensures that the dataset used in Notebook 05 (Model Training) is clean, fully numeric, consistent, and suitable for supervised regression modelling.\n",
        "* The engineered feature set will later support:\n",
        "  * Model performance evaluation (R² score)\n",
        "  * Price predictions for the 4 inherited houses\n",
        "  * Real-time predictions in the Streamlit dashboard\n",
        "* Every transformation applied here must be reproducible and applied identically during inference (prediction).\n"
