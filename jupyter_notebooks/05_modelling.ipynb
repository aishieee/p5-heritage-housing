        "* To train, evaluate, and compare predictive models that estimate house sale prices using the engineered datasets created in 04_feature_engineering.ipynb.\n",
        "* I will build two regression models — Linear Regression (using scaled features) and Random Forest Regressor (using unscaled features) — and assess their performance on the Ames housing dataset.\n",
        "* The final step will be to select the best-performing model and use it to generate sale price predictions for the client's four inherited houses.\n",
